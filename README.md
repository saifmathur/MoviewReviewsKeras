<h2>GloVe: Global Vectors for Word Representation</h2>
<h4>Context</h4>
<p> GloVe is an unsupervised learning algorithm for obtaining vector representations for words. Training is performed on aggregated global word-word co-occurrence statistics from a corpus, and the resulting representations showcase interesting linear substructures of the word vector space.</p>
